# RegexForWriters
Built for technical communicators and others who do a lot of text editing but not much coding, this basic program goes through the files in a directory and updates the text using regular expressions. 

Getting started is pretty fast. Just open the program, specify the file types you want to edit, and add regular expressions to update the text the way you want.
